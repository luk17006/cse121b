    <h1>Games and Dates Comparison</h1>

    <p>This is not by any means a complete list of video games, just a large sample to choose from. If a game does not have a day in its date (shows month and year only), it will not compute correctly. I tried for hours to remedy that issue but just couldn't find a way :/ Most games do have days in their datesm however, so you may never even see this issue come up.</p>
